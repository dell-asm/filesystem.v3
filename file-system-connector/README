Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for File Systems

Steps to build Google Enterprise Connector for File Systems 2011
================================================================================

1. Ensure you have Java 6.
   You can get it from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

2. Ensure that you have Apache Ant installed on your system.
   You can get it from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

3. Ensure you have Connector Manager on your system. From
   http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/downloads/list
   choose connector-manager-2.4.0-src.zip or later  
   3b) Unpack the zip file. (unzip connector-manager-2.4.0-src.zip). The contents
       will go into a new sub directory of your current directory called 
       connector-manager-2.4.0-src.
   3c) Change directory to connector-manager-2.4.0-src.
   3d) Build the connector manager (ant connector-manager).
   3e) While still in the connector-manager-2.4.0-src directory create a
       google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties file in your home directory.  
   
       For Unix enter
         echo "connector-manager-projects.dir=$PWD" > ~/google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties 

       For Windows
         echo connector-manager-projects.dir=%CD% > "%HOMEPATH%\google-enterprise-connector-filesystem.properties"

4. Change directory to projects/file-system-connector which contains this README
   file. Execute "ant jar_prod" to build the file system connector jar file
   build/prod/jar/connector-filesystem.jar.

5. To verify your set up run "ant run_tests". You should see 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL'
   at the end, which means your setup is correct.
