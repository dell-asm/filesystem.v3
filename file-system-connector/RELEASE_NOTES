Release 2.8.6, May 4, 2012
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to review
the changes below to determine whether to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 6109697: File system connector throws a NullPointerException and
               halts traversal. The exception may be logged to stdout
               or in catalina.out. This issue was introduced in
               version 2.8.4 and can occur when the traversal user
               does not have permission to read the files in a
               directory.
Issue 5589982: File-system connector fails to crawl Samba share,
               SmbException: 0xC000011F is observed. The problem could
               potentially occur on other SMB implementations, but has
               only been reported on Samba shares.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5237436: File system connector doesn't allow including patterns for selective folders under a file share.
Issue 5111509: File system connector goes into infinite loop when connector is reset. This is reproducible only for
               very small file shares.

Advanced Configuration Properties
---------------------------------
For more details on the advanced properties, see 
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-file-system/wiki/AdvancedConfiguration

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using version 2.8.0 may be used with this
version. Connector instances from earlier versions must be upgraded
manually. See the section below about release 2.8.4 for more details.
This version works with Connector Manager version 2.8.0 or later.
Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will not work correctly with
this version of the connector.


Release 2.8.4, February 21, 2012
===============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to
upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 5398852: File System connector should not modify last access
               time on folders when lastAccessResetFlagForSmb is enabled.
Issues 5734921, 5735103: Do not store access times when
               lastAccessResetFlagForSmb feature is off. This avoids
               a memory leak and performance degradation.
Issue 5806403: Connector sends delete feeds when the share is only
               temporarily available.
Issue 5028655, 6019938: Fix logic bug where recovery-files' age comparison
               was broken.  This could lead to the connector resending the
               same files again after Tomcat was restarted.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5237436: File system connector doesn't allow including patterns for selective folders under a file share.
Issue 5111509: File system connector goes into infinite loop when connector is reset. This is reproducible only for
               very small file shares.
